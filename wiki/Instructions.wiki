= Adding a Finarea/Betamax Service =

In order to add a service, such as sipdiscount.com, you need to manually edit the FinareaMidlet.jad file (open it in a text editor) and add these four lines for each service you want to use:

 * service-0-name: sipdiscount
 * service-0-account-provider: sipdiscount.com
 * service-0-account-username: your_username
 * service-0-account-password: your_password 

In the example above sipdiscount is the first service. If you want to add more services, use  *service-1-**, *service-2-**, etc.
